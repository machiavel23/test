>#### (Good Burger)
>It's the summer of 1997. You are a teenage employee for an establishment of the Good Burger fast-food chain. Good Burger is famous for its sauce, the recipe for which still remains confidential. As a Good Burger employee, you are required to know the recipe and have sworn to protect its secrecy at all costs. A rival fast-food chain, Mondo Burger, has opened up an establishment across the street. Mondo Burger is known for its fancy futuristic decor and oversized burgers. Kurt Bozwell, Mondo Burger's egotistical CEO and manager, aims to put Good Burger out of business and make Mondo Burger the #1 fast-food chain in the world. Mondo Burger's zealous employees are completely obedient to Kurt and revere him as a god. Mondo Burger often sends attractive spies disguised as customers to Good Burger to seduce its employees into giving up the secret sauce recipe. You and your fellow co-workers try to do whatever it takes to fend them off. You believe Mondo Burger might be using an illegal growth chemical on their burgers to make them so large which may also have a side-effect on customers, but you're still searching for the evidence to bust them. It's a seemingly normal day so far. Good Burger just opened for today and you begin your shift. A customer walks in and stands at the counter. You smile and recite the usual line, "Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, can I take your order?" The customer proceeds to order

>#### (Vampire)
>The world is a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to maintain their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity).The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.

>#### (American Psycho)
>You live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street. Your name is Patrick Bateman. You're 27 years old. You believe in taking care of yourself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if your face is a little puffy, you'll put on an ice pack while doing your stomach crunches. You can do a thousand now. After you remove the ice pack, you use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, you use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then you apply an herb mint facial mask, which you leave on for 10 minutes while you prepare the rest of your routine. You always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real you. Only an entity, something illusory. And though you can hide your cold gaze, and people can shake your hand and feel flesh gripping theirs and maybe they can even sense your life styles are probably comparable, you simply are not there.
