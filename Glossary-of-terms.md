================================================================

#### Notice: This is mostly a tool for you to help understand what the heck people are saying in the threads because everyone refers to terms all the time without actually saying what those terms are or their meaning.

================================================================

**CYOA**: An acronym for choose your own adventure.

**AIDs or /aids/**: An acorynm for AI Dungeon Storyteller. It's how we refer to the general.

**Colab**: The thing that let's you play AI Dungeon in your browser.

**Official Version/Base Game**: The original version of the game known as AI Dungeon. Could also mean the official game website. It depends on the context of the conversation.

**Mormon**: The guy who created AI Dungeon. We don't really care about him so we refer to him as Mormon instead of his real name.

**(((HIM)))**: Same thing as Mormon.

**CloverAnon**: One of the main developers who works on the Clover version of AI Dungeon.

**thadunge2**: The anon who created Thadunge version of AI Dungeon.

**Visualfag**: An anon who worked on the visual aspects of the Colab and made it look prettier and more organized.

**Pastebinfag**: The anon that handles adding custom prompts to the custom prompt page. A hero we need but not the one we deserve.

**Kornilov**: One of the main developers working on the wiki and other various things. He overworks himself so be patient. For some reason he always announces himself instead of using a trip.

**HolobotAnon**: Some guy who really loves Holo and Spice and Wolf in general and tried to make the AI accept Spice and Wolf into it's heart but failed. His brave sacrifice gave us helpful information.

**NovelAnon**: The anon who created the Novel Model. He created a model by using a bunch of novels. The results were surprisingly pleasing.

**/vg/ autist**: That guy who complained for more than 20 threads in a row that the threads we had on /v/ should be moved to /vg/. Some say he still lurks the threads to this day.

**Clover/Clover version**: The version of AI Dungeon made by anons that has a clover as it's logo. It also has unique commands.

**Thadunge/Thadunge version**: The version of AI Dungeon made by thadunge2 that has unique commands different from the base game and Clover.

**Offline**: Usually means the version of AI Dungeon that runs on your PC. It doesn't use the browser at all.

**Commands**: The commands input in the text box while playing AI Dungeon. An Example: /revert to redo an action in game. For more information on this and any other commands check out the [Commands](https://github.com/VBPXKSMI/Open-CYOAI-Project/wiki/Game-commands) page. 

**Temp/Temperature**: The setting that helps dictate how random the AI is when you play. Usually a decimal like 0.4.

**Top_k/Top_keks**: The setting thing that helps dictate how random the AI is when you play. Usually a whole number like 20.

**Top_p**: The third setting that dictates how random the AI is when you play. Usually a decimal like 0.9.

**Model**: The thing people train the AI with and use to make AI Dungeon play differently from the way it is in the original version.

**Novelmodel**: The model that was made using novels. Surprisingly good for smut.

**Smut model**: The model that was made using purely smut. The problem is it's awful and can't even form proper sentences most of the time. It's not worth using. Don't do it.

**Dragon smut model**: One anon was very open about the fact that he wanted to sleep with dragons so he made a model using dragon smut. It's good at one thing and one thing specifically. That is making sweet love to dragons.

**Pytorch**: Usually always refers to the model that Clover version specifically uses.

**MegAnon folder**: Some anon's MEGA that contains most of the models we currently have available for download.

**Cell**: A box on the Colab page that holds all the code needed to run the game. There is more than one depending on which Colab version you use.

**Disconnect bug**: The "bug" that is causing people to disconnect when using the Colab version of the game. It's not a bug, it's Google kicking you out because they own the place and want more resources. There is no fix for this.

**Prompt**: This is what you put when you start playing a custom game. As an example: You are a knight that lives in the land of Larion. You have a steel sword and shield. Your companion is a cute catgirl named Lilly.

**Context**: Usually refers to what the AI remembers when the /remember command is used. For more information on this and any other commands, check out the [Commands](https://github.com/VBPXKSMI/Open-CYOAI-Project/wiki/Game-commands) page. 

**image splat**: The mod that pulls up pictures from google images(or whichever site you specify) while you play AI Dungeon. An example: A ferocious dragon appears. It then pulls up a picture from google images of a ferocious dragon. This mod only works on the offline version so far.

**GPT-2**: The thing that makes the AI able to run AI Dungeon in the first place. This is too complicated to word it any other way really.

**Lilly**: The most popular catgirl in all of /aids/ history. She's some anon's waifu that we all NTR because we can. You thought you didn't have an NTR fetish but think again.

**Technical Terms and More Details**:

- **Colab**: Short for Google Colaboratory. It's a service Google provides for free to allow people to use their unused high-tech server hardware (powerful CPUs and GPUs) to run random scripts ("Colab notebooks") using a web interface. Google also reserves the right to kick you off when they want the hardware back. This is the number 1 reason your AIDS game gets killed.
- **Official version**: The official version of the game, a.k.a. AI Dungeon 2. Found [here](https://play.aidungeon.io/).
- **GPT-2**: A large pretrained text generation neural network, trained and released by OpenAI. Basically, it's a big machine learning model where you give it some text, and it generates more text based on that, word by word. GPT-2 was trained on tons of text, cost them millions of dollars to develop, and it is pretty good and generating convincing, even creative-looking text. AIDS uses GPT-2 to generate stories.
- **124M, 355M, 775M, 1558M**: Refers to different versions of GPT-2. More specifically, referring to the number of parameters in each. I.e. the 1558M has 1.5 billion parameters.
- **Training**: Refers to updating the model parameters through machine learning magic. May also refer to the pre-training or fine-tuning.
- **Pre-training**: Refers to the original training of GPT-2 that OpenAI did. We will never do this because it's hilariously expensive.
- **Fine-tuning**: Refers to training the pre-trained GPT-2 on additional text, to make it generate text of some genre (e.g. NarutoXSasuke fanfiction). AIDS was fine-tuned on some CYOA text that the Mormon downloaded somewhere.
- **Vanilla GPT-2**: Refers to the GPT-2 model(s) released by OpenAI, without any further fine-tuning.
- **GPUs**: Yes, really the GPUs in your computer. Some autists figured out how to use GPUs for science to compute shit really quickly. See also: CUDA/cuDNN
- **CUDA/cuDNN**: NVidia proprietary libraries that make computations/deep learning models very fast. Unfortunately the easiest to run code make use of these, so if you have an AMD GPU you're going to need to jump through some hoops.
- **Deep Learning**: A category of machine learning models that work very well. Consists of multiple layers of piece-wise continuous functions, generally trained using gradient descent, [blah blah blah](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
- **Transformer**: A deep learning model architecture invented by Google. GPT-2 is a Transformer-based model.
- **Python**: Programming language that most of the AIDS code is written in. May also refer to the program used to run Python code.
- **pip**: A program that installs additional libraries to your Python installation.
