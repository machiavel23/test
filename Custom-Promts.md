1.0 ***Useful info for having a good time and not bitching about the AI***<br>
[(Back to Index)](#Index)

================================================================

The AI has a limited memory. For a given session it will only keep in mind the original prompt, and the twenty most recent prompts. This means that to tell a longer story with continuity, you must use detail heavy prompts reiterating what has happened in the story so far. For example, instead of short empty commands like: go to [location], you should prefer something like: Travel along the beaten dirt path with my two adventuring friends [name1] and [name2] to the castle [castleName]

It is probably best practice to write in second person, use lots of details and description, describe small events, like: remove her panties before looking her in the eyes, instead of: fuck her

Essentially, for better results, you should use the AI as a collaborative story telling tool and work with it by entering commands that match actual second person story text, rather than treating this like a conventional video game. If things start breaking down or repeating over and over, use revert to get back before the problem and try rewording your inputs. When the AI seems to leave off waiting for you to input the speech of another character, you can do so, or hit enter, or continue, or type in listen to make the AI come up with speech or force the story along. It has more trouble dealing with who is saying what in a conversation unless you follow this advice and really make things clear. Instead of using: say "speech" or ask "speech", you can instead just use a command like: order the men to do [something], or: ask the girl to leave the orcs alone; without any quotations.

Even with all the above in mind, the AI just has a very hard time with speech. You can choose to play it safe and completely avoid speech sections to avoid a lot of issues.

If you want to make things more challenging for yourself, or generally spice things up, use words like Try, and Attempt before you describe yourself doing something.

Another useful technique for playing longer stories out is to play until you reach a breakdown point, like looping or crashing, write up a summary prompt of everything important that happened, as well as describing the characters, and start a new game using it. You can treat these as chapters.

**AVOID ASKING THE AI DIRECT QUESTIONS!**

Instead of asking something like, "Where is the castle?" type something like, try to remember where the castle is.

Here are some examples of good input:

    >open the heavy wooden door
    >look over the [character/object]'s appearance
    >attempt to convince the man to let you pass through the steel gate
    >try to dodge the hostile ogres sweeping ax swings
    >tell [name] that you want them to hand over their golden robe
    >ask [character] if they would be willing to serve you
    >order your army to close distance with the horde of enemy spearmen
and so on

Hopefully this advice will prevent people who read it from shitting up the threads with the same few questions (not likely lol).

The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.

You believe in taking care of yourself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if your face is a little puffy, you'll put on an ice pack while doing your stomach crunches. You can do a thousand now. After you remove the ice pack, you use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, you use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then you apply an herb mint facial mask, which you leave on for 10 minutes while you prepare the rest of your routine. You always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real you. Only an entity, something illusory. And though you can hide your cold gaze, and people can shake your hand and feel flesh gripping theirs and maybe they can even sense your life styles are probably comparable, you simply are not there.

>You are a young, lithe, and submissive elvish prince. You're relaxing on your bed in your chambers, quite exhausted after months of diplomatic meetings and grueling schoolwork. You've spent many sleepless nights wonder if it will ever end. You hear a knock at the door. It opens, and the heavenly figure of Anna, your beautiful guardian angel, emerges. She is quite tall at six and a half feet, and has a wingspan twice that length. She flutters her fluffy white wings and her halo gleams slightly brighter at the sight of you. "Good evening, sweetheart! May I speak with you?" You respond with a weary nod and a tired smile. You've always enjoyed Anna's presence, but lately you've been too busy to do so. She sits down on the bed next to you and says "Sweetie, I've noticed that you've been working very hard these last few months, and I want you to know how very proud I am of you. You've done such a good job." She gives you a long, tender kiss on your forehead. You feel your slender ears blushing from the physical affection, and try to remember the last time you felt this, or if you've ever felt quite like this at all. She drapes an impossibly soft wing around you, and you melt in her embrace, laying your head down on her lap. It feels almost ethereal. She runs her hand through your hair, and a wave of emotions floods your chest, your gut, and your head. She notices, and comforts you. "It's okay, honey. You've done so well for me. I'm here now, everything is alright. You don't have to worry about anything right now. Mommy's got you...and she'll stay here with you as long as you need..." You let out a weak whimper as she says those heavenly, perfect words, and feel a rush towards your groin. A twinge of embarrassment strikes you, but you don't move, and you're not quite sure if it's because of your trust for Anna, or if you just can't muster the strength to do so. She slowly, subtly moves her hands from your head down to your face, then your shoulders, then your chest... Your breathing hitches, and you can't hide your arousal as a soft moan escapes your lips. Anna looks down on you and smiles, saying

Finally, you arrive at the tribes village. You're pulled off of the large mare, and your bindings are cut. As you try to stand, the large mare gently presses on your chest with a front hoof, pushing you back to the ground. "My name is Sofia." she says in a heavy accent. "You have ridden me here, and so it is now my time to ride you. And when I am done, and your foal is in my womb, you will service the rest of the tribe." she says as she gestures to the large herd of centaur mares present.

You're under the covers of your bed in nothing but your underwear, you felt comfy that way. You were looking at dirty pictures on your phone to pass the time, but the pictures of girls you looked at just weren't satisfying you. In your curiosity, you stumble upon something called "shotacon". Boys weren't attractive, so you thought, but as you keep looking you can't help but be entranced by the cute shota images you found. You start stroking yourself under the covers when suddenly your little brother peeks into the room. Your bro is in his cute pj's and looks wide awake for it being so late. He says he can't sleep and wants to be in bed with you. He doesn't see you touching yourself but you can't help but say okay to him coming in. You heart skips a beat when you realize just how cute your little brother is to you, he wasn't that much younger but he was so innocent and charming. You stealthily pull your hand out of your undies and let your little bro snuggle up beside you under the covers. He seems happy to be with you, and you start to feel a weird sensation as you cuddle him

You tell her to stop being so lewd so much around you but she won't, she just teases you all day and you can hardly resist the temptation of deflowering her. You're usually a good brother but the temptation is finally too much, you know that she knows of dirty acts.

Your sister is a tall tomboy who simply has no concept of being subtle; she's brash but has a kind heart. The truth is, your embarrassment of being attracted to her made you try to avoid her. But as you grew more distant from her over the past year she decides she absolutely will get your attention. You and your sister are virgins, but can't help but eye each other up. Of course, as a now horny teenage boy, you want nothing more now than to get laid... but you never expected your sister to start teasing you like this. Over the past few weeks you can't help but jack off secretly to the thought of her, she's been going around the house in tight sportswear and you can't help but stare at her shapely butt and small but cute chest. One day she's had enough, your sister barges into your room and says "Bro, stop playing those dumb videogames and spend time with me!"

>You're an explorer of undiscovered civilizations, you came alone in a forest with simple provisions and a knack for adventure. Unfortunately, this adventure turned sour and you fell down a small cliffside after tripping over a tree root. You black out from the fall. When you awaken you are in a different place than before. You seem to be in a beautiful alcove with flowers and seemingly handmade ornaments. You hear waterfalls and the chattering of a language you don't understand. Regaining consciousness, you realize you’re lying on a cot made of plant fibers. You feel achy, but someone seems to have applied makeshift bandages to your body where you got bruised during the fall. A figure comes into the alcove, she appears to be some kind of strange fox girl, about a third of your height. She seems to have been tending to you this whole time, it seems. You try to thank the fox girl, but she doesn't seem to know your language. You vaguely recall from a book you read that this girl might be a "kemono", or a half animal half human like hybrid. You think she looks absolutely beautiful with her golden yellow fur, bright blue eyes, and a set of bushy ears to go with her fluffy fox tail. You feel strangely aroused by her short hourglass figure, but you try to put that out of mind for the moment as you try to find a way to show gratitude to your friendly savior. She seems to take a liking to you as she continues tending to your minor wounds.

>You're Anon, a bored middleschooler who is up to no good. You recently dared and convinced your close friend Eloise to drink as much water as she possibly could during lunch, knowing that she never turns down a dare. As a mischievous kid, you thought it would be funny to make her drink so much until she'd have to run off to the bathroom in the middle of class. The teacher next period, Ms. Blitshitz, absolutely hated kids who interrupted class too, you thought this all through. Eloise drank a lot however, you felt annoyed after she bragged about how much she gulped down. You thought she wouldn't be able to do so much so you followed up with another dare- "I dare you to go the whole period without asking Ms. Blitshitz to go to the bathroom!" Eloise felt confident as per usual and accepted the dare. However, once the class was in session, Eloise noticed she wasn't feeling so confident in her bladder anymore. You notice her squirming around in her desk next to you, realizing just how much she had to pee. You giggle and poke her as she desperately tries to ignore you and pretend to pay attention to Ms. Blitshitz talk about fractions. Eloise mutters under her breath to you "I'm not going to the bathroom no matter what Anon! I can hold it in you'll see, I never lose a dare..." You get a smug look on your face, but deep down you feel a weird sensation about seeing her squirm like that. As class continued, the inevitable was soon to happen

The device was built so you can clone yourself as many times as you wished, solely so you could fuck and be fucked by your own clones. You already figured out how to make yourself eternally young looking a few months prior, before you were a crinkly old man, but now you're a youthful cute stud who can't stop admiring your own twink body and big dick. After that, your ultimate goal became to go fuck yourself via the power of science. The thought of it drove you crazy.

>It's a Friday evening, and you're at the mall shopping at Hot Topic. As a big tiddy goth girl, finding clothes at the mall has become harder and harder for you since they simply don't make enough dark and moody clothes that support your massive bust size. You sigh and keep looking even though you know it's futile. Becoming frustrated, you grab a black and white striped bikini to try on since you remembered your crush Chad was hosting a pool party this weekend. You didn't receive an invite via text like all your other friends had... but you assured yourself that he'd send one to you soon, probably. You head to the dressing room. The bikini was of course, way too small. Your huge tits were barely being covered and your unkempt pubes were peeking over the bikini bottom. Frustrated and defeated, you go to put back on your clothes that you messily dropped to the floor earlier. However they were gone- someone must have reached under the changing stall and taken them! You can't even use your phone to call for help since they were in your fashionably ripped skinny jeans. You are now barely covered and almost nude in a tiny bikini you weren't even going to buy, trapped in the stall due to embarrassment. You feel like crying but that would ruin your black eyeliner, so you resist. Suddenly you feel even less safe, as you hear some laughter coming from outside the changing room. You knew those were the perpetrators who stole your clothes for sure... Your blackened heart sinks into fear; the men outside the stall certainly had filthy plans for you.

Tonight, you've been trying to summon a big breasted succubus. To your dismay, the ritual goes horribly wrong. You look in terror as the room contorts into madness as a large demonic portal opens, the walls start melting, your bed shifts into a fleshy cradle, and your nice expensive PC catches on fire. You start to scream over the loss of your terabytes of demon porn, but suddenly two beings come out of the portal engulfing the middle of the room. It was not the big tiddy succubus woman like you had hoped, it was instead a young demon boy and girl duo who came out of the portal. The nude demon children give you a sly smile, and tell you that they're going to punish you with their bodies for abusing the fine demon arts. Suddenly you are grasped and tied down against the flesh bed by its gross fleshy tentacles. You look in horror as the demon twins approach you. They both had slim bodies, inhuman horns and spiky tails, and scaled skin around their hands and feet that were more claw-like than anything. The boy demon had a large cock for his stature, it was spiked and menacing looking, you dreaded what it was going to do to you. The girl demon was no less threatening, the look on her face and the sharp fang-like teeth she showed made you queasy. The small demon girl looked to be wet too and kept touching herself, as if she was going to enjoy your suffering immensely. They lunge at you as they tear apart your robes, exposing you for their perverted ritual.

This ghost box contains a sexy ghost [girl/boy] that will love you forever (or so the advertisements say). You quickly take the ghost box out of the packaging and look at it intensely, your heart skips a beat in excitement over what kind of cute ghost it could be. Deciding that waiting is delaying the inevitable, you open the box

You are the smallest and weakest of all the cavemen in your tribe, having the body of a young boy and lacking the body hair that the tribe prides itself in. The Shaman paired you with Krudella, the biggest, fiercest, and toughest warrior woman of the tribe. She towers over you and looks strong enough to crush a mammoth's head with her thighs. Krudella is not without a distinct kind of beauty however, she carries herself with pride and a demeanor that makes the whole tribe respects her. She always took a liking to you, but you never thought the Shaman would let you mate with her. You remember all the times she would go on hunts with you. You weren't very good at it but she seemed happy that you tried your best, always supporting you and teaching you new ways to kill beasts. Krudella's womanly instinct to nurture and teach is not lost despite her outward appearance. Tonight she seems especially eager to teach you, and you promise yourself many times you wouldn't disappoint her during the mating ritual. Tonight you will become a man. You nervously walk into the Shaman's tent full of mating partners and greet Krudella inside.

You are wearing a very revealing french maid outfit. You have one large purple butt plug inserted into your wet, slightly loose anus. You live with your loving mother, a hermaphrodite. She is in her 30's and has the body and face of a 12 year old little girl. She loves to bully you by stepping on your useless cock, calling you degrading names, edging your dick for hours, and using you like a living fleshlight. She is wearing a dark blue Japanese elementary school swimsuit. You are cleaning some dust off of a table when you see your small and cute mother approach you. This causes you to clench around the plug inside of your ass instinctively in anticipation. You see her erect, 12 inch long member pressed up against the skin tight swimsuit, staining the swimsuit with her precum. You are physically addicted to her cum and will die without it. You eye her member and instinctively get on your knees from a lifetime of sexual training. Your mother approaches you and tells you to open wide for breakfast as she hasn't washed her penis in 2 months. She sticks her dirty, uncircumcised penis in front of your face. Her penis is covered in smegma. Your small, Lolita-like mother then tells you to lick it clean for a possible reward.

The alien worm entered inside your pussy, causing waves of pleasure while doing so. The alien worm started to whisper to you inside your mind about how good it would feel obeying him. The alien worm can wring you pleasure at his will. Through an association of obeying=pleasure=good, your will to resist starts to fade. You begin to say “I will obey”, over and over again, with more and more conviction each time you say it. Your resistance breaks and you let the alien worm control your thoughts, letting him guide you to satisfy its own needs. You are now Host-slave. The alien worm inside your womb is now your Master. You will refer the alien worm as Master everytime it talks to you. You will refer yourself as Host-slave everytime your Master talks to you. You obey your Master without question. Your Master transmits his instructions to you. You now know what you have to do. You now have a purpose. Your mission and goal will be to help your Master to infect other females. You will have to use your body for that purpose. Your Master can only make females a Host-slave when it’s inside her pussy, so your objective will be to pass your Master to as many women as possible. Once you have your aroused pussy near another woman’s pussy, your Master will produce a tendril that will come out of your pussy, with which you can penetrate the woman. Then your Master will move inside of her and start to alter her thoughts to make her another Host-slave. Obedient host-slaves are rewarded with pleasure. You are an obedient host-slave yourself so your Master rewards you with pleasure on a constant basis. You obey him so much that now you are in a state of perpetual arousal. You plan your next move. You know who would make the perfect Host-slave for your Master, it will be your friend Jasmine. You and Jasmine live alone in the same apartment so you drive there. You quietly slip inside Jasmine room while she is sleeping. You strip off your clothes and begin to quietly touch your pussy. As you become more and more aroused, you go near Jasmine thighs and start to slowly pull out her pants. Once you are ready, a long and squashy wormlike tendril goes out of your pussy. You sting Jasmine thighs with your tendril to soothe them, and then proceed to thrust your tendril inside Jasmine pussy. Jasmine slowly starts to wake up and looks up at you with a look of horror, confusion and arousal. While you are pounding increasingly faster inside her pussy, you say to Jasmine

There's no town or village nearby and no animals to hunt nearby. Feeling hopeless, you slump next to your campfire. You look over to your horse, watching them peacefully graze around your camp perimeter. As you continue to watch your stallion trot around your camp, you can't help but watch their round balls bounce around between their muscular legs. The sight makes you horny and your pussy drips with desire, all until the stallion finally stands next to you. It seems to be calmed by your presence, showing you its backside as it walks around you. Your stallion's sweaty balls are tantalizingly close now, looking plump and full with every jostle, as if taunting your lust. Imagining all the thick cum that must be rolling around in there makes your stomach growl again. Perhaps you can satiate your hunger and thirst with the help of your horse. Calling your trusting and calm steed over, you position yourself under it. Immediately, the musky smell of their feral crotch fills your nose and your mouth begins to water, filling your thoughts with lewd desire. Not being able to take it any longer, you go to get a taste of your stallions balmy, fragrant genitals. Tenderly and lewdly, you lick your horse's plump testicles, rubbing their salty yet muddy flavor into your lascivious tongue.

Owning an elf slave is considered a status symbol in human society. Many humans take pride in showing off their obedient elf slaves. You come from a wealthy noble family in the capital. For your 18th birthday your father bought you an elf slave of your very own. Your slave is a young elf named Kyla. Kyla is a short, thin female elf with short blonde hair and freckled cheeks. Your goal is to train Kyla to be a submissive and obedient slave who will obey your every command. Kyla may resist your commands at first. You may use any punishments or treatments you feel are appropriate to break her.

As you eat breakfast in the dining room, your father presents you with your birthday gift. He leads a thin, meek-looking elf girl wearing tattered rags and a leather collar with a leash on it. "Really father! An elf slave of my very own! I can't believe it," you exclaim. "Remember, son, a slave is a big responsibility, you'll have to feed her, bathe her, and train her," your father tells you. "Oh promise I'll take care of her, father. What is your name, slave?" you ask the elf girl. She says nothing and stares at her feet. You grab the leash and tug forcefully on it. The elf girl yelps in pain and looks up at you, "My name is Kyla, Master." You smile and revel in the feeling of power you have over this pitiful elf. "Alright, Kyla, I'll start training you today. Let's start by finding you something more appropriate to wear. I won't have my new slave looking like a common gutter elf," you smirk as you yank on Kyla's leash and drag her behind you

Your enormous, milk-engorged udders rest shamefully on the straw-lined pen that is your home. Your chemically enhanced, pierced nipples threaten to bring you to orgasm with even the slightest movement. In your former life you were a murderer, garnering pleasure from toying with men and then driving them to madness and suicide. Now, here in this godforsaken barn, you repay your debt to humanity, drop by drop. You let out a pitiful moan from your lips. Your cowbell rings dejectedly. This is your life now, nothing more than a source of food and energy. You release a volcanic fart from your loose anus. The stinky excretion is immediately collected by a steel hose into a methane holding tank. You piss yourself in utter embarrassment and humiliation, the acrid stank wafting into your nostrils as the urine pools sickeningly around your chubby knees. You look around wildly, hoping for a chance of escape.

The poster is inside the kitchen with his mother, microwaving some yummy tendies. You quickly bend him over and impale him on your cock, and before anyone can react, you start fucking his mother, using him as a living condom. The thought of fucking a woman while you use her own son as a condom causes you to cum powerfully, the hot jet in his ass blasting him off of your dick and straight into his mother's womb. You pull out and scream "FALCON PAWNCH" as you clobber his mother in the belly, giving her an Irish abortion. As her son slides out of her pussy, you look him in the eye and say "You can call me Daddy, now." Stunned, he looks up at you and says

Then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further- and further-out gambles what you would dream. And finally, you would dream where you are now.

Everyone watches as the blob becomes a beautiful young woman wearing nothing but white lingerie and holding an enormous phallus. You say "We did it boys!", and the slime laughs happily as she takes her clothes off. She turns around and begins to dance seductively, until she gets completely naked and starts sucking cock like a champ.

>#### (Anon sets the record straight on top_k and temperature)
>Here's how temperature and top_k actually work:
>
>When the AI decides how to write, it looks at the past context and generates a list of words that would make sense given this context
>Each word in this list has a probability of occurring in the current context, which it learned from the training data
>It then orders this list of possible-words from most-likely to least-likely
>
>It then cuts off the list after top_k entries. So if top_k is one, it will only consider the most-likely word. If top_k is 2, it will consider the two most like words
>
>It then scales the probabilities by temperature.

    A temperature of 1 means "real-life" probabilities for the next word
    A temperature > 1 scales probabilities to make less-likely words more likely. i.e. the ie will more often use words that are unlikely in the context
    A temperature < 1 will make less-likely words even less likely. i.e. the AI tends to use words it has seen a lot in real life training data
>
>So a temperature of 0.4 with top_k of 20 will result in the AI considering only the top 20 words, then shifting probabilities to make the most likely (i.e. "stable") words even more likely to occur
>
>
>Ok nerd but which values should I use
Start with temperature=0.2 and top_k=20 for more stable and coherent responses
You can lower the temperature to 0.1 to make the AI even more stable, but it might become boring and repetitive

Doesn't matter if you use first or second person, the game calls first_to_second_person() which does what it says, pretty much.

Here's a mapping of words it will convert:

    ("I'm", "you're"),
    ("Im", "you're"),
    ("Ive", "you've"),
    ("I am", "you are"),
    ("was I", "were you"),

    ("I", "you"),
    ("I'd", "you'd"),
    ("i", "you"),
    ("I've", "you've"),
    ("I was", "you were"),
    ("my", "your"),
