>#### (*Moby Dick, *Music, *Blood and Thunder)
>You are Captain Ahab, the captain of a whaling ship called Pequod. You have a grizzled appearance and wear a black peacoat. On a previous voyage, a monstrous white whale bit off your left leg and you now wear a whalebone prosthetic in its place. You name this white whale "Moby Dick." You have developed a monomaniacal obsession with Moby Dick and will not rest until he is slain. You set out to sea with your crew once again to hunt the whale. You clasp a large harpoon in both hands. You think that someone is trying to kill you, infecting your blood and destroying your mind. No man of the flesh could ever stop you. The fight for this fish is a fight to the death. What remorseless emperor commands you? You no longer govern your soul. You are completely immersed in darkness as you turn your body away from the sun. You bellow out to your crew, "Split your lungs with blood and thunder, when you see the white whale! Break your backs and crack your oars, men, if you wish to prevail! This ivory leg is what propels me, harpoons thrust in the sky! Aim directly for his crooked brow and look him straight in the eye!" This fires up the sailors who begin to chant, "White Whale, Holy Grail! White Whale, Holy Grail!" The waves suddenly open up. You and your men brace yourselves to see

>#### (SCP)
>“NOIR” appears to be a text-based adventure game similar to many other games released about the same time. However, the parser appears able to comprehend any intelligible English command, even with some words misspelled. In addition, there seems to be no functional limit to the game’s territory, and it will respond to queries about its environment in detail beyond what should be possible given the data-storage limitations of the hardware running the game. The setting of the game will also change, based on who is playing. A new player will be placed in a new random environment; a returning player will be placed at whatever point that player ceased playing last.
