Here you will find most info regarding AI Dungeon, how to play it, how it functions, the different versions that exists, etc.

Everything in the Wiki was made and based off the experiences and posts of countless different Anons from 4chan.

================================================================

This page has 2 tables of contents:
* The [first one](https://github.com/VBPXKSMI/Open-CYOAI-Project/wiki#introductory-contents) is intended for the newcomers to the game, and to get started.
* The [second one]() (COMING SOON) is intended for the more experienced players, containing a more detailed list of the most useful pages in the Wiki.

  * **Protip**: The **sidebar** to your right is your friend, it lists the most useful pages in the same manner as the second table of contents. Use it to navigate through the Wiki with ease.
