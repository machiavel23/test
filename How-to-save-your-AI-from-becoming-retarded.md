In this page, I will show various tricks you can use to try and save your AI from crashing. THIS IS NOT A GUIDE TO TROUBLESHOOT THE INSTALLATION PROCESS OF YOUR MODEL OR GAME. I EXPECT THAT YOU HAVE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL GAME WITH A TRAINED MODEL.

**Chapter 1: Preventative measures**

Listen here you little fucks, temp does indeed do something, but it's not what it seems. The lower the temp, the more the AI will try what SHE THINKS are the safest responses for your commands. The contrary is true for high temps. NEVER and I tell you NEVER try to play with temps above 0.8 if you wish to make interesting and sensical content. 

top_p is not that much important. In laymans terms ,it will generate all the possible answers the AI could give. Just place it in 0.4 when you want your AI to follow you around and 0.6-0.9 when you are feeling adventurous. Warning, placing top_p at 0.4 in low temp will not always mean you can hand hold the AI by her hand, she will make hiccups, that's what you get for trying to put degenerate porn stories into an AI of general purpose stories. 

NOW **THIS PART IS IMPORTANT** this is the main thing that will help you solve problems. Using the character "/" in the game will enable you enter a parameter to the AI. You can change top_p (/topp #) and and temp (/temp #) mid game in case you don't like the behaviour of the AI. However the most important commands are "/context" and "/remember". "/remember" will save any text you throw beside the command and will be remembered for the rest of the story. She will not replace other remembered text, so be REALLY carefull to avoid contradictions as much as possible. NEVER replace or erase in things you have already remembered, it will fuck your AI for obvious reasons. "/context" will show you all the things you remember and you can set up a new scenario to your game. This little thing will help you practically skip any part you find boring and try to set up a new, more interesting scene. The command also helps if you smell something wrong with the AI.

**ALWAYS** answer to the AI's words. If you don't want to engage in an adventure the AI set up for you, try to say to her "decide to ignore x or/and y.", or other sensical shit. Ignoring the AI will confuse and break the ai.

**Chapter 2: Problems and solutions**

Problem 1: AI cannot stop repeating herself: Probably the most annoying thing that could happen. It is common on low temps and due to the shit model (((HE))) implemented, she really thinks is safe to repeat herself over and over again. The moment it happens revert that shit immediatly and find another way to continue your adventure. If it keeps happening, revert 2 times, you are never sure. In case you are retarded to not hear that advice, augment the temp and retry until the repeat is gone.

Problem 2: AI is spouting nonsense:  This happens because you were stupid with a high temp play and you allowed yourself to ignore whatever the AI was spitting. NEVER ignore what the AI says. She will remember the conversation for up to 20 lines and if the only things she reads is non-sense, guess what genious, she will spout nonsense on whatever you do. For this case you really need the "/remember" for your story, and then do "/context" . After that, you copy the context given and you paste it in a new game with a custom genre. This is in a way saving, not the code, but the story you created and it is quite helpful for most players.  

Problem 3: AI is uncooperative: common for high temps. Could be a number of factors, it could be bad luck, it could be you accidentally gave a temp too high, or the top_p is too high. It could be all of the above AFAIK. Always try "/retry" and "/revert" and always check your grammar. They are usually easy to fixes once you know what's the problem.

I am a namefag called Edea Poster, if you guys want me to adress any obscure AI problem I will see what I can do and update this pastebin if needed.
