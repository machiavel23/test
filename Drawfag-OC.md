[To share your own OC](https://github.com/AIDungeonpastes/AID2-Art) (you need a Github account).

    (X) All you need to do is make a GitHub account with a throwaway email, like mail.com, and then fork the project. 
    Then you just have to upload the image into the art folder and start a pull request to get it merged into the main thing so that anyone can see it.

    (X) You just upload the picture to the art folder and copy what I did in index.html to display it.
    Not anyone can just upload unless I give you permissions to do so, to edit the repo you'd have to make a pull request and someone with the correct permissions would authorize it.

================================================================

**Outdated / Not being worked on**

We need someone to upload the images to the booru, [here are most of them](https://www55.zippyshare.com/v/eqNHLaYL/file.html).

[/v/ booru](https://vidyart.booru.org). 

When uploading to the booru, make sure to tag them with this (the tag is in between ""):

    -"AIDungeon2": this one should be put to ALL
    -"DrawfagOC": to the stories the drawfaggots illustrated
    -"OC": to thread/aidungeon2 related OC made by anons
    -"Stories": to the screencaps stories posted by anons

The first 2 are the most important ones, rest is secondary.

Another thing left to do would be to download and then upload every single screencaped story posted in the threads. This part might be not worth it, but I think the best ones deserve to be saved.
