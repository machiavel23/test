Status consists of Attributes, Weapon, Armor and Magic masteries. In X world you can use X magic, X Armor, X Weapon. Attributes are Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Luck, etc, etc, etc. Strength does X."

The AI pretty much stops trying to direct the story on it's own and just goes with your prompts. Obviously it'll be up to you to direct the story then, but those settings are really nice if you just want the AI going along with your ERP.

>When the AI decides how to write, it looks at the past context and generates a list of words that would make sense given this context

    A temperature of 1 means "real-life" probabilities for the next word
    A temperature > 1 scales probabilities to make less-likely words more likely. i.e. the ie will more often use words that are unlikely in the context
    A temperature < 1 will make less-likely words even less likely. i.e. the AI tends to use words it has seen a lot in real life training data
>
>So a temperature of 0.4 with top_k of 20 will result in the AI considering only the top 20 words, then shifting probabilities to make the most likely (i.e. "stable") words even more likely to occur

>Ok nerd but which values should I use
Start with temperature=0.2 and top_k=20 for more stable and coherent responses
You can lower the temperature to 0.1 to make the AI even more stable, but it might become boring and repetitive

Doesn't matter if you use first or second person, the game calls first_to_second_person() which does what it says, pretty much.

Here's a mapping of words it will convert:

    ("I'm", "you're"),
    ("Im", "you're"),
    ("Ive", "you've"),
    ("I am", "you are"),
    ("was I", "were you"),
    ("am I", "are you"),
    ("wasn't I", "weren't you"),
    ("I", "you"),
    ("I'd", "you'd"),
    ("i", "you"),
    ("I've", "you've"),
    ("was I", "were you"),
    ("am I", "are you"),
    ("wasn't I", "weren't you"),
    ("I", "you"),
    ("I'd", "you'd"),
    ("i", "you"),
    ("I've", "you've"),
    ("I was", "you were"),
    ("my", "your"),
    ("we","you"),
    ("we're", "you're"),
    ("mine","yours"),
    ("me", "you"),
    ("us", "you"),
    ("our", "your"),
    ("I'll", "you'll"),
    ("myself", "yourself")
