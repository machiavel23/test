You are Lawrence. "Lawrence, -hic- it is cold. May we -hic- share a bed tonight?" Holo asked you, hiccuping from drinking too much apple wine. "Holo, you're drunk. Just go lie down and sleep," you replied sleepily. "Nonsense! I am the wise wolf! I do not get -hic- drunk!" She crawls into your bed and snuggles up against your side. You sigh and pull the blanket over Holo. You close your eyes and try to fall back asleep. Suddenly, something wet touches your neck. Your eyes flew open. Did Holo just... lick you? It happened again. Yes, it was definitely Holo's tongue. You turn to her to see her smile and giggle.

    3)  "I was just kidding, Lawrence. I just wanted to check if you were really drunk." "Holo, you are really drunk. You should just go to bed. You can't be serious about kissing me. That's gross!" She giggles at you.

    1)  "You want me to turn off the light?" You ask her. "I am starting to lose it, Lawrence. You are the most innocent man I know. I do not want to ruin this perfect evening. The stars are shining and I am feeling happy. I need some more alcohol."
    2)  "Hey!" You scream and jump back into bed. "Hold still!" You yell and pull the blankets up over your face. "Nooooo!" She lets out a little shriek of frustration. You and Holo continue to make out as she continues to lick your neck.
    3)  "What's the matter? You don't like it? Well, you can stop now. I'm tired. I'll wait for you to finish cleaning up." She giggles, and you see the blush on her face.

TEMP=1.0

    1)  "Oh, my adorable baby fox! You must be hungry!" Holo chirps and runs a paw down her belly. She knows you are tired, so she hiccuped as she pulls herself up onto your lap. "I want you to eat my baaaddy.... "
    2)  She pats your chest, giggling. "Aw, my sweet Lawrence! It's too much fun to just ignore. Come here." She reaches down and takes your hand and drags you over to her bed. "Come closer and let me taste you," she whispers to you.
    3)  It was too cute. You wince and try to push the fingers that were on your neck aside. Holo giggles again. You have a wild idea that perhaps she is a tease, but you also have a wild thought that perhaps it's another master that has his, ah...
    4)  It is quite a comfort to realize that she isn't mad at you, although she looks a little worried. What are the odds of Holo licking you so many times and getting a result? Not good. But... you just want to give her a big kiss. So you open your eyes.
    5)  "Holo, can you -hic- get to sleep? It's -hic- cold in the -hic- house," you moan, completely dazed. She hops onto the bed and rolls on top of you.

TEMP=1.1

    1)  Holo chokes on her wine and quickly gets out of the bed. The fire alarm alerted Lawrence. Holo's movements are quick and haphazard when she leaves the room. Lawrence scolds himself from doing so before getting up to clear the room for Holo's gajord.
    2)  You end up getting up and rinsing the saliva from your mouth. You walk into Holo's room and find her already sitting up. I'm the best in the world, you thought. (You tried to sneak up behind her while she slept.
    3)  "You see, Lawrence, the 'touch' we had earlier isn't just a one-time event. I am an extremely shy cat. I must live up to my host's standards to really show him how 'wild' I can really be."
    4)  You chuckle, the body heat in your low body heat burning a hole in your mattress. "Holo,"
    5)  You almost feel bad for her, because she was just trying to distract you from the munchkin threat. She put her tongue back inside her mouth as you laugh. You close your eyes again. May the harvest be with you, your people are vast and populous. Have you been treated well?

    1)  She peeks up from under the blanket and peers into your eyes. You blush intensely and shake your head back to block the sunlight that hits your face. What gave you away? Oh, so that's the cunning idea!
    2)  She runs to your side, grabbing your arm and squeezes. Next, Holo places a softer kiss on your neck. You've loved this kid for a while. It feels like her heart would stop if she wasn't so fast at kissing.
    3)  Thankfully, other than her sudden tongue, nothing else made it onto the blanket. (You in your mind knew it was what was happening, trust me.) You lie there allowing her tongue to rub your neck, and turn your eyes closed.
    4)  Not bothering to roll out of the bed and lean back into it to try and solve the falling ceiling problem, you slowly lean your back against the top of the bed and retreat up to the fetal position.
    5)  "Lick me and lick me and licked me and ate us both, bitches," she said in an attempt at teasing you. With that, you leave the room where Holo... totally planned...

    1)  "Sorry. Giggling feels kind of good, doesn't it?" "I don't-" you start, but Holo wriggles out from between your legs and grabs a plate of your water your decaf post-training diet advice.
