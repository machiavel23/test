Here's how to make the Colab versions of AI Dungeon 2 look playable on mobile phones.

STEP 1. Download the Hacker's Keyboard app, set it up and configure it to your liking.
		I recommend 50 percent height in landscape mode, 5 row compact layout in landscape mode, and 50% 5th row height adjustment.

STEP 2. Go to your phone settings, on the section where you set the phone's font size and screen zoom (varies from phone to phone)
		and make stuff as small as possible, smallest font size and farthest zoom.
		--You may want to revert and re-do this everytime you play the game--

STEP 3. If you use the same google account on both computer and phone, just make sure you're logged on to your Google Drive app.
		If you use a different Google account on your phone, you'll first need to open your copy of the colab on your computer,
		click "Share" on the top right of it, and add your phone account, make sure it has permission to "edit" te Colab.
		Even if you use different accounts, log your computer google account in your google drive app as a secondary account.
		
STEP 4. Open the Colab link/file in your phone using the Chrome Browser. Run its cells in the right order as you usually do on PC.
		When it asks for the google drive authentication, do it with the account that actually has the game files in it.
		If you have different accounts, then the one you use on the computer is probably the one that has them.
		
STEP 5. When you're running the last cell, the one that plays the actual game, touch the "3 dots" icon on the top=right of the cell,
		and choose the option to run the cell in fullscreen. [Playing on landscape highly recommended]

There you go, it doesn't look like shit, fits in your screen and your keyboard is properly functional.
