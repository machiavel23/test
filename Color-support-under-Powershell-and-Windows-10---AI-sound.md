Dunno if someone cares, but I edited play.py & story_manager.py of the uncensored GitHub version to have some color support under Powershell and Windows 10, since I found it disorienting when it got too long.

I also added a typewriter bell sound that plays when the AI is done generating shit and you are able to type again, so you can do other shit while keeping it in the background.

It requires the python modules "colorama" and "playsound" to be installed with pip.

Just extract the contents into the main folder and let it overwrite it.
