**BEWARE**, that this is absolutely inferior to any of the other versions in this Wiki. Even the free version (that works on Colab) of (((HIS))) works better than this. Also no Anon is working on this. Some of the known issues with it:

**(1)** No commands (most crucially, no revert).<br>
**(2)** Temp is too damned high.<br>
**(3)** Text appears one letter at a time, significantly slower than you can read it.<br>
**(4)** Unnecessarily sets a floor for character length of prompts.<br>
**(5)** Formatting adds newlines unnecessarily.<br>
**(6)** Previous point combined with font size and generous line spacing means you always have to scroll up to read the response.<br>
**(7)** No options whatsoever.<br>
**(8)** Seems to use an older version of play.py (why?).

## Questions

>#### Is it a proper client or a customized browser that runs on Colab?
>No one is sure of this, it could be a proper client but everyone calls BULLSHIT on that, he is probably running the game on Google Colab's free servers, just like the rest of us and is charging a fee to "maintain" the supposed servers. This APP has no settings, and you also need to login with email/password so it's a bit of a botnet.

***

>#### How do I get (((HIS))) APK to run?
>(1) Download on phone.<br>
>(2) Enable install from unknown sources in settings.<br>
>(3) Open ".apk" in a file explorer, if you don't have a file explorer get one from google play/f-droid.

>#### Ok, but now I have to enter an email address? I donâ€™t want to use my real one!
>Just use a burner/temporary email.
