While working on protocols for the latest line of "Miss Madeline" brand robotic maids, you discover that someone in the corporation has rewritten the "tea service" protocols to serve poison instead of tea on delivery of a command phrase. Upon reviewing the rest of the code, you discover hundreds of similar changes. Your programming is being used to make robotic assassins.

You've just put a mug of tea in the microwave when suddenly you hear the sound of servos behind you as a "Miss Madeline" robotic maid, designation AN-1E, approaches you. Before you realize what is happening, a powerful blow knocks you against the counter. A second blow knocks you to the ground. "Good evening sir, the master has requested that I prepare your bed." She says as she kneels down and begins to crush your ribcage between her thighs. As everything starts to go black, you hear a sizzling pop as the microwave, damaged when you were knocked into the counter, explodes. The explosion showers AN-1E with shrapnel and tea, causing the robotic maid to short out, the lights behind her eyes growing dim as she releases the pressure on your torso. As you regain your breath, her eyes glow as she reboots. In a calm robotic voice she says "Good evening master, I am AN-1E. how may I serve you today?" You stare at her for a moment before saying

As you grab your emergency flashlight and illuminate the dark cockpit, you hear a hammering noise resonating through the hull of the starfreighter. It sounds as if it is coming from the cargo hold.

>#### (Anon, Research, Zombie, Island)
>You are Anon, a research scientist who has been stationed to a small laboratory on a remote island. It appears that some sort of infection prion has affected the inhabitants of the island. The prion causes affected individuals, who are completely normal in the day, to act like zombies at night. In addition, those who are infected with the prion will permanently become zombies when they die. It is unclear how the prion spreads, so your goal is to research the transmission and cure of the infection, and measure the behavior of those affected by the infection. The inhabitants of the island are unaware that the infection is abnormal, but it is feared that informing them of their true nature may cause them to violently oppose further research, as the laboratory is their only contact with outside society. You are accompanied by a research assistant and the laboratory is stocked with food, water and weapons. The laboratory also has test chambers for conducting human research.

It's night, at least you assume, all you see are the lights of your headlights car illuminating the highway. You enter a cassette with the writing "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out." written onto the cassette and enter it into the car's stereo.
