    >this is not a game, go to /tg/

>IF this is not a game then neither is Zork nor none of the thousands of text based games, even modern CRPGs could be included in this category by this logic, so fuck off. This is a game.

    >this is a general, you even have a standard OP and don't stop posting threads, go to /vg/

>First, we have this OP because the game is literally unplayable without it, the instructions are necessary to keep the tech support posts up to a minimum and have the most OC posting in the thread.
>
>Second, this is a game where you can do literally anything, so each story is guaranteed to be different, having infinite possibilities means no repetition (or low amounts of it), thus each story posted is different, and so is OC, making that no thread is the same as the one that came before it.
>
>Third, with that many different stories, OC is likely to be more common, as proven by the drawfags we have since the first thread.
>
>And finally, /v/ has the same countless Nintendo, Pokemon, twittershit, e-celebs threads every single day, filling the catalog with nothing but shitposting instead of talking about actual games. Here none of that happens, so if we are a general at least we are not cancer. Again, fuck off.

    >join this discord guysssss

>NO, discord trannies can go fuck themselves. The same goes to drama bitches.

    >why are you pirating this? That's illegallllll

>The GitHub is public, meaning we can do whatever the fuck we want with it, especially when the software (GPT-2 model) that was used to build it is Open Source. 
>
>And if the author ever puts a paywall (already has, the greedy one), it will be up to you if you want to pirate it, the same if you wanted to donate to him.
> 
>And if you really want to talk about the morality of piracy, go then and make a thread yourself about it, here we don't give a shit.

    >why are you trying to fuck dragons / trannies / your sister / underage girls / etc. in the game? MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS this is a porn game with CP.

>This game lets you do anything as long as you have imagination.
>
>So if an Anon wants a dragon to anal vore him, fuck a trannie, a not so of legal age girl, or shove his cock on Lilly's ass, you can be damn sure he has every right to do it. 
>
>For fucks sake, you can literally abort a child and shove it up your ass in this game. What kind of story you get itâ€™s entirely your responsibility and up to you and only you.
>
>[Even the fucking AI calls you out](https://i.ibb.co/R4WtMmh/1576346169847.png), shitposting faggot.

    >why is there so much /d/egenerate shit in the custom prompts paste?

>Because moralfaggotry belongs on Reddit, go away if you don't like it faggot.

**tl;dr**

As long as we keep the technical questions at a minimum (by having a highly detailed functional guide in the OP) and avoid shitposting, drama queens, etc., you can shove your complaints in your asses.
