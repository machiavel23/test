This is an in-game editor for the last 8 results and the starting text, this version is based on the latest commit from Thadunge2’s GitHub version. 

The editing will probably only work locally on Windows since the input function normally isn’t able to be prefilled for easier editing.

This is not only cosmetic, the game seems to react to edited text just as if it would have generated it itself.

[Version with just the editor](https://files.catbox.moe/auqn4q.zip).

[Version with editor + colors](https://files.catbox.moe/e9wi9b.zip) (Colors work atleast on CMD and Powershell).


With both versions just extract the contents into the main directory and let it replace the files.
